#Termometer with LED blinking indication

STM32F0Discovery ADC Temperarure sensor testing for my learning. NO StdPeriph used. 
Everyone can copy or change it but i don't sure what it will be helpful for someone else ))

Blue LED showing a decades and green showing a units of temperature degres. 
For example +21Â°C will show as 2 blinks of blue led and 1 blink of green.
